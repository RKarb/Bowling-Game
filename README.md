# Bowling-Game

'Bowling Game' is a simple 3D game with a fixed perspective. The original goal of this project was to create a piece of interactive software for a childrenâ€™s charity, in order to be an option for children to choose from when seeking a form of entertainment. The project itself its written in C# using the Unity game engine, specifically Unity 2019.4.4f1. All models and assets used in the project are open source with minor alterations from myself, such as the selectable colours of the bowling ball and floor.

The game itself features a scoring system and physics-based gameplay, simply put: the player is in a fantasy bowling alley. The existing objects are the bowling ball itself, bowling pins and the bowling alley floor. As previously mentioned, the colours of the bowling ball and alley floor can be selected from within a menu prior to pressing play.
